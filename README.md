Take a look! 

I designed the site in **Figma**, taking care of accessibility details. 
For development, I used **HTML & CSS** skills for the structure and styling, 
and I used media queries to make the site responsive to different screen sizes.
I also used **JavaScript** for the responsive navigation menu.

⚠️ Feel free to improve the website or report any issues!
